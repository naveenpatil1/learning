                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The concept of 'People as Resource' refers to the idea of considering a country's population as an asset rather than a liability. This perspective emphasizes the productive skills, abilities, and knowledge of the population that contribute to the Gross National Product (GNP). Population becomes human capital when investments are made in education, training, and medical care, enhancing their productivity and economic value. Unlike the traditional view of population as a burden due to the challenges of providing food, education, and healthcare, 'People as Resource' highlights the positive side of a large population. When properly developed, human resources can drive economic growth and development, similar to physical capital formation. This concept underscores the importance of investing in human capital to achieve higher productivity and better economic outcomes.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The division of economic activities between men and women often reflects societal norms, cultural expectations, and historical gender roles. Traditionally, men have been associated with formal economic activities such as industrial work, business, and agriculture, while women have been confined to informal or unpaid roles like caregiving, household work, and subsistence farming. This division impacts the economy by undervaluing women's contributions and limiting their access to education, training, and employment opportunities. Over time, trends such as increased female participation in the workforce, gender equality initiatives, and investment in women's education have begun to challenge these norms, leading to greater economic productivity and human capital formation. For example, India's IT revolution has seen significant contributions from women, highlighting the importance of gender inclusivity in economic growth.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Human capital formation, which involves investment in education, training, and healthcare, plays a crucial role in bridging the gender gap in economic activities. By providing equal access to education and skill development, women can participate in high-productivity sectors traditionally dominated by men. For instance, initiatives to educate girls and provide vocational training have empowered women to enter industries such as technology, healthcare, and entrepreneurship. Additionally, healthier populations, including women, contribute to higher productivity and economic growth. Governments and organizations worldwide have recognized this, implementing policies to reduce gender disparities in education and employment. For example, India's focus on women's education and skill development has led to increased female participation in the workforce, contributing to the country's economic progress.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Seasonal unemployment refers to a type of unemployment that occurs when individuals are unable to find work during specific seasons of the year. This is common in industries such as agriculture, tourism, and construction, where the demand for labor fluctuates based on seasonal patterns. For example, agricultural workers may face unemployment during non-harvest periods when farming activities are minimal. The impact on the economy includes reduced income for workers during off-seasons, lower overall productivity, and increased dependency on informal or temporary jobs. Seasonal unemployment can also lead to economic instability in regions heavily reliant on seasonal industries. Addressing this issue often requires diversifying employment opportunities and promoting skill development to enable workers to find alternative jobs during off-seasons.

                    Disguised unemployment refers to a situation where more people are employed in a job than are actually needed, resulting in underemployment. This typically occurs in sectors like agriculture, where a large number of workers contribute little to productivity. Unlike open unemployment, where individuals are actively seeking jobs but cannot find any, disguised unemployment involves individuals who appear to be employed but are not fully utilized in terms of their potential. For example, in a farming family, if 10 members work on a small plot of land that requires only 5 workers, the additional 5 workers are considered to be in disguised unemployment. Their removal would not affect the overall output. This form of unemployment is common in developing countries and highlights inefficiencies in resource allocation.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Disguised unemployment has several negative impacts on the economy. It leads to underutilization of the workforce, resulting in lower productivity and inefficient allocation of resources. This, in turn, hampers economic growth and development. For example, in rural areas, disguised unemployment in agriculture prevents labor from being redirected to more productive sectors like manufacturing or services. To address this issue, governments can focus on creating non-agricultural jobs, promoting skill development, and investing in infrastructure to support industrialization. Encouraging entrepreneurship and providing access to credit can also help shift surplus labor to more productive activities. Additionally, improving education and training programs can equip workers with skills needed in emerging sectors, reducing reliance on low-productivity jobs.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Education and health are interlinked and together form the foundation of human capital formation. Education equips individuals with skills and knowledge, while health ensures they can effectively utilize these capabilities. Investment in health is as critical as investment in education because a well-educated but unhealthy population cannot contribute optimally to economic productivity. For example, malnutrition or chronic illnesses can hinder cognitive development and learning outcomes, reducing the effectiveness of educational investments. Countries that balance investments in both sectors, such as Finland, achieve better human development indices and economic performance. Thus, health and education must be prioritized equally to maximize human capital formation.

This process transforms the population into an asset for the economy rather than a liability, as educated individuals contribute to the Gross National Product (GNP) and overall economic growth.", "marks": "4 Marks", "important": true}, {"id": 33, "question": "Discuss the relationship between investment in education and the concept of 'People as Resource'. Include examples to illustrate your answer.", "answer": "The concept of 'People as Resource' highlights the idea that a population can be an asset for the economy when it is equipped with productive skills and abilities. Investment in education is a key factor in realizing this potential, as it transforms individuals into human capital. Education enhances cognitive abilities, technical skills, and problem-solving capacities, enabling people to contribute effectively to economic activities. For instance, India's IT revolution is a prime example of how investment in education and training led to the development of a skilled workforce, which significantly boosted the country's economic growth. Similarly, the Green Revolution in India demonstrated how knowledge and education in agricultural practices increased productivity and improved food security. These examples underscore the importance of viewing education as an investment that yields long-term economic and social benefits.", "marks": "5 Marks", "important": true}, {"id": 34, "question": "Explain how investment in health contributes to human capital formation and economic growth. Provide examples to support your answer.", "answer": "Investment in health plays a crucial role in human capital formation by ensuring that individuals are physically and mentally capable of contributing productively to the economy. Healthier individuals are more likely to have higher productivity, lower absenteeism, and longer working lives. For instance, access to medical care reduces the prevalence of diseases, enabling people to work efficiently. Additionally, healthier populations reduce the economic burden of healthcare costs on governments and families. This investment yields returns in the form of higher incomes and improved quality of life. For example, countries like Japan and South Korea have demonstrated how prioritizing healthcare has led to sustained economic growth and higher standards of living.", "marks": "5 Marks", "important": true}, {"id": 35, "question": "Discuss the relationship between education, health, and human capital formation. Why is investment in health considered as important as investment in education?", "answer": "Education and health are interlinked and together form the foundation of human capital formation. Education equips individuals with skills and knowledge, while health ensures they can effectively utilize these capabilities. Investment in health is as critical as investment in education because a well-educated but unhealthy population cannot contribute optimally to economic productivity. For example, malnutrition or chronic illnesses can hinder cognitive development and learning outcomes, reducing the effectiveness of educational investments. Countries that balance investments in both sectors, such as Finland, achieve better human development indices and economic performance. Thus, health and education must be prioritized equally to maximize human capital formation.", "marks": "4 Marks", "important": true}, {"id": 36, "question": "Explain the role of vocational training in transforming population into human capital. How does it contribute to economic development?", "answer": "Vocational training plays a crucial role in transforming the population into human capital by equipping individuals with specific skills and knowledge required for various industries. Unlike general education, vocational training focuses on practical and job-oriented skills, which directly enhance employability and productivity. By investing in vocational training, individuals can acquire expertise in fields such as healthcare, IT, manufacturing, and services, leading to higher incomes and improved standards of living. For the economy, vocational training reduces unemployment, bridges the skill gap, and increases the Gross National Product (GNP). It also supports innovation and entrepreneurship, fostering sustainable economic growth. This transformation highlights the importance of human capital formation as a key driver of development.", "marks": "4 Marks", "important": true}, {"id": 37, "question": "Discuss the trends in vocational training in India. How has the IT revolution influenced vocational training programs in the country?", "answer": "In India, vocational training has evolved significantly over the years, with increasing emphasis on skill development to meet the demands of a growing economy. Initially, vocational training was limited to traditional trades such as carpentry, tailoring, and agriculture. However, with the advent of the IT revolution, there has been a paradigm shift towards technology-driven skills. The IT revolution has influenced vocational training programs by introducing courses in software development, data analytics, cybersecurity, and digital marketing. Government initiatives like Skill India and the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) have further accelerated this trend by partnering with industries to design market-relevant training modules. These programs aim to prepare the workforce for emerging sectors, ensuring that India remains competitive in the global economy.", "marks": "5 Marks", "important": false}];
