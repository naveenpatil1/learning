                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    India's shared borders with its neighbours present both challenges and opportunities. Challenges include border disputes, such as the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan, which have led to conflicts like the Kargil War (1999). Illegal migration, particularly from Bangladesh, has strained resources in border states like Assam. Smuggling and cross-border terrorism, especially from Pakistan, pose security threats. However, these borders also offer opportunities for cooperation. For instance, the India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship allows for open borders and free movement of people. The India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement (2015) resolved long-standing territorial disputes, fostering better relations. Trade routes, such as the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway, enhance economic ties. Thus, while challenges persist, India's borders also provide avenues for strengthening regional integration and development.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    82°30'E has been selected as the Standard Meridian of India because it lies almost in the middle of the country longitudinally. This ensures that the time difference between the easternmost and westernmost parts of the country is minimized. The Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours, meaning it rotates 15° in one hour. Therefore, there is a time difference of 4 minutes for every degree of longitude. Without a standard meridian, different regions of India would have different local times, leading to confusion in daily activities, transportation, and communication. By adopting 82°30'E as the Standard Meridian, India maintains a uniform Indian Standard Time (IST) across the country, which is 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The Tropic of Cancer (23°30'N) is a significant latitude that passes through the middle of India, dividing the country into almost two equal halves. It influences the climate, as regions to the south of the Tropic of Cancer experience a tropical climate, characterized by high temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons. In contrast, regions to the north have a subtropical climate with more variation in temperature. The Tropic of Cancer also plays a role in determining the intensity of solar radiation received by different parts of India. During the summer solstice, the sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer, leading to longer days and higher temperatures in the regions it crosses. This affects the type of vegetation, with tropical forests and grasslands being more prominent in the southern regions, while northern regions have deciduous and alpine vegetation. The Tropic of Cancer thus has a profound impact on India's climate, agriculture, and biodiversity.

                    The Tropic of Cancer, located at 23°30'N latitude, is a significant geographical marker as it divides India into two almost equal halves: the northern temperate zone and the southern tropical zone. This division influences the climate, vegetation, and agricultural practices of the regions. The Tropic of Cancer passes through eight Indian states: Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Tripura, and Mizoram. For instance, areas north of the Tropic of Cancer experience more pronounced seasonal variations, while regions to the south have a predominantly tropical climate.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    India spans a vast longitudinal extent of 68°7'E to 97°25'E, resulting in a time difference of nearly two hours from its westernmost point to its easternmost point. To avoid confusion and maintain uniformity, 82°30'E was chosen as the Standard Meridian of India. This longitude passes through Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh and is centrally located, making it a practical choice for the entire country. The Indian Standard Time (IST) based on this meridian is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This decision ensures that all regions in India follow the same time, facilitating coordination in daily activities, transportation, and communication.
