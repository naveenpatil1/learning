                        <div class="concept-description">Stalinism refers to the policies and practices of Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1953. A major aspect of Stalinism was the policy of collectivisation, implemented in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Under collectivisation, private farms were abolished, and peasants were forced to work on collective farms (kolkhozes) controlled by the state. By 1929, Stalin announced the 'Dekulakization' campaign, targeting wealthier peasants (kulaks) who resisted collectivisation. Millions of peasants were displaced, and widespread resistance led to violent crackdowns. The policy resulted in a severe famine between 1932 and 1933, particularly in Ukraine, where it is estimated that 3-5 million people died.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The French Revolution had a profound impact on societal change by introducing powerful ideas of freedom, equality, and individual rights. Before the revolution, society in Europe was divided into estates and orders, with the aristocracy and the church holding economic and social power. The revolution challenged this structure, making it possible to envision a society based on equality and individual rights. These ideas spread beyond Europe to Asia, where thinkers like Raja Rammohan Roy and Derozio in India discussed their significance. The colonies also reshaped these ideas, adapting them to their own contexts. This period marked the beginning of debates on who should control social power and the rights of individuals, laying the foundation for modern political ideologies.

                    Conservatives, liberals, and radicals represented three distinct political ideologies in the nineteenth century, each shaping societal change in different ways. Conservatives believed in preserving traditional institutions and were resistant to rapid change, advocating for gradual reforms if necessary. Liberals supported individual freedoms, equality before the law, and a limited role of the state, emphasizing gradual progress and constitutional governance. Radicals, on the other hand, sought a complete restructuring of society, often advocating for revolutionary changes to achieve equality and justice. These ideologies influenced political movements and debates, with liberals and radicals pushing for reforms while conservatives aimed to maintain the status quo. Together, they shaped the discourse on societal change during the Age of Social Change, influencing policies and revolutions across Europe and beyond.

                    Liberals, Radicals, and Conservatives represented distinct political ideologies in 19th-century Europe. Liberals believed in individual rights, freedom, and equality before the law. They supported constitutional governments and the idea of a free-market economy but were cautious about drastic social changes. Radicals, on the other hand, wanted a complete restructuring of society. They advocated for universal suffrage, the abolition of privileges based on birth, and greater economic equality. Conservatives preferred maintaining traditional institutions like the monarchy, the church, and the aristocracy. They accepted gradual change but were wary of revolutionary transformations. These ideologies influenced societal change by shaping debates on governance, rights, and economic systems, leading to reforms and revolutions across Europe.

                    The French Revolution had a profound impact on the ideologies of Liberals, Radicals, and Conservatives. Liberals were inspired by the Revolution's emphasis on individual rights and equality, advocating for constitutional governance and legal reforms. Radicals drew from the Revolution's more transformative aspects, such as the abolition of feudal privileges and the push for universal suffrage, aiming for deeper societal restructuring. Conservatives, however, viewed the Revolution as a threat to traditional institutions and sought to preserve the monarchy, the church, and the aristocracy. For example, while Liberals supported limited reforms like the expansion of voting rights, Radicals pushed for broader participation and economic equality, and Conservatives resisted these changes, favoring stability and gradualism.

                    Conservatives, liberals, and radicals represented different political ideologies during the nineteenth century, each with distinct views on societal change. Conservatives believed in maintaining traditional institutions, such as the monarchy, aristocracy, and the church, and were resistant to rapid changes. They supported gradual reforms only if necessary to preserve stability. Liberals, on the other hand, advocated for individual rights, equality before the law, and the establishment of constitutional governments. They supported the idea of free markets and opposed the concentration of power in the hands of the aristocracy or the church. Radicals sought a complete restructuring of society, often favoring revolutionary methods to achieve social and economic equality. They were critical of both conservative and liberal approaches, aiming for a society free from class distinctions. These ideologies shaped the political and social landscape of Europe during the Industrial Revolution and influenced debates on how to address the inequalities brought about by industrialization.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The French Revolution (1789–1799) had a profound impact on the ideas of social change in Europe and its colonies during the Industrial Age. It introduced the concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity, challenging the traditional hierarchies of estates and orders. The revolution demonstrated that it was possible to overthrow entrenched systems of power, such as the monarchy and the aristocracy, and replace them with more egalitarian structures. In Europe, these ideas inspired debates among conservatives, liberals, and radicals about the nature and pace of societal change. For example, liberals advocated for constitutional governance and individual rights, while radicals pushed for more comprehensive social and economic reforms. In colonies such as India, intellectuals like Raja Rammohan Roy and Derozio engaged with these ideas, using them to critique colonial rule and traditional practices. The French Revolution thus became a catalyst for global discussions about rights, governance, and the restructuring of society during the Industrial Age.

                    Liberals, radicals, and conservatives represented three distinct political ideologies in 19th-century Europe, each with differing perspectives on societal change. Liberals believed in individual rights, the rule of law, and a constitutional government. They supported gradual reforms to ensure equality before the law but were not in favor of universal suffrage. Radicals, on the other hand, sought a complete restructuring of society. They advocated for universal suffrage, the abolition of privileges based on birth, and the redistribution of wealth to reduce inequality. Conservatives were opposed to rapid changes and wanted to preserve traditional institutions like the monarchy and the church. They believed that change should be slow and respect historical continuity. These ideological debates influenced the coming of socialism, as radicals and some liberals began to question the inequalities of the capitalist system and sought alternative models of governance and economy. Socialism emerged as a response to these inequalities, advocating for collective ownership of resources and a society based on equality and justice.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The French Revolution (1789) had a profound impact on the development of socialist ideas in Europe. It introduced the concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity, which challenged the traditional hierarchical structure of society. The Revolution demonstrated that it was possible to overthrow entrenched systems of privilege, such as the monarchy and aristocracy, and replace them with a government based on the will of the people. These ideas inspired debates about societal change across Europe. Thinkers and activists began to question the inequalities perpetuated by capitalism and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few. The Revolution also highlighted the importance of collective action and the role of the working class in shaping society. Socialist thinkers like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were influenced by these ideas, which they developed further in their critique of capitalism and their vision for a classless society. The French Revolution thus laid the ideological groundwork for the emergence of socialism as a powerful political and economic movement in the 19th and 20th centuries.

                    Socialism is based on the principles of collective ownership of resources, equitable distribution of wealth, and the prioritization of social welfare over individual profit. Unlike capitalism, which emphasizes private ownership and market-driven economies, socialism seeks to reduce class disparities by ensuring that essential services such as education, healthcare, and housing are accessible to all. Socialism advocates for the redistribution of wealth through progressive taxation and government intervention in the economy to prevent exploitation and ensure fairness. These principles aim to address social and economic inequalities by promoting inclusivity, reducing poverty, and fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility.

                    The Russian Revolution of 1917 marked a turning point in the global spread of socialism. The Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, established the first socialist state, which inspired workers and intellectuals worldwide. Key events include the October Revolution (1917), which overthrew the provisional government, and the establishment of the USSR in 1922. The revolution demonstrated the possibility of a radical restructuring of society, leading to the adoption of socialist policies in several countries. Throughout the 20th century, socialism influenced anti-colonial movements, labor rights campaigns, and welfare state policies. The Cold War further amplified its global significance as socialist and capitalist ideologies competed for dominance.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The socio-economic structure of the Russian Empire in 1914 was deeply unequal and heavily influenced by feudal traditions. The majority of the population were peasants, many of whom lived in poverty despite the abolition of serfdom in 1861. They faced high taxes, poor living conditions, and limited access to land. Industrial workers in cities like St. Petersburg and Moscow worked long hours in unsafe conditions for meager wages, leading to growing unrest. The nobility and aristocracy, who owned vast estates, continued to dominate the economy and politics, while the middle class was small and lacked significant influence. Additionally, the empire's diverse ethnic groups, such as Poles, Finns, and Ukrainians, often faced repression under the policy of Russification, which sought to enforce Russian language and culture. These factors created widespread dissatisfaction, setting the stage for revolutionary movements and the eventual collapse of the empire.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Tsar Nicholas II, the last emperor of the Russian Empire, ruled as an autocrat in 1914, holding absolute power over the state. His leadership was marked by a resistance to political reform and an inability to address the growing demands for change from various social groups. Despite the establishment of the Duma (parliament) after the 1905 Revolution, Nicholas retained ultimate authority and often dismissed the Duma when it opposed his policies. His reliance on repressive measures, such as censorship and the use of the secret police, alienated many citizens. Furthermore, his decision to involve Russia in World War I placed immense strain on the economy and military, leading to food shortages, inflation, and heavy casualties. These issues eroded public confidence in his leadership and contributed to the instability that culminated in the Russian Revolution of 1917.

                    The French Revolution significantly altered the economic and social structure of Europe by challenging the traditional division of society into estates and orders. Before the revolution, the aristocracy and the church held control over economic and social power. The revolution introduced ideas of freedom, equality, and individual rights, which inspired debates on who should hold social power and how society should be organized. These ideas spread across Europe and Asia, influencing reformers like Raja Rammohan Roy in India. The revolution also led to the emergence of political ideologies such as conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism, which debated the pace and extent of societal transformation. This marked a shift from hierarchical systems to discussions about democratic and egalitarian structures.

                    Conservatives in nineteenth-century Europe believed in preserving traditional institutions and were resistant to rapid societal changes. They supported gradual reforms to maintain stability. Liberals advocated for individual freedoms, representative government, and economic reforms, emphasizing the importance of private property and free markets. Radicals, on the other hand, sought profound and immediate changes, including the restructuring of society to achieve equality and social justice. These political traditions influenced societal and economic changes by shaping policies and movements. Conservatives often slowed the pace of change, liberals pushed for constitutional reforms and economic liberalization, while radicals inspired revolutions and the rise of socialism, exemplified by the Russian Revolution, which aimed for a complete transformation of society.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Socialism is a political and economic ideology that advocates for collective ownership of the means of production and distribution, aiming to reduce social inequalities and promote economic fairness. In Russia, socialism gained traction due to widespread dissatisfaction with the autocratic rule of the Tsar, economic hardships, and the exploitation of workers and peasants. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, championed socialist ideas and sought to establish a classless society through radical changes. The Russian Revolution of 1917 was heavily influenced by these principles, as it aimed to overthrow the Tsarist regime and replace it with a government based on socialist ideals. This led to the establishment of the Soviet Union, where socialism became the foundation of governance and economic policies.

                    The Bolsheviks, under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, played a pivotal role in implementing socialism in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917. They abolished private ownership of land and redistributed it among peasants, nationalized industries, and established state control over production and distribution. The Bolsheviks also introduced policies such as the New Economic Policy (NEP) to stabilize the economy while transitioning to socialism. Their efforts aimed to create a classless society and eliminate inequalities. However, the implementation faced challenges, including resistance from various factions, economic difficulties, and the need to consolidate power. Despite these obstacles, the Bolsheviks laid the foundation for a socialist state, which later evolved into the Soviet Union.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The 1905 Revolution in Russia was driven by a combination of social, political, and economic factors. Socially, the Russian population was deeply divided, with peasants suffering from poverty and land shortages, while industrial workers faced harsh working conditions and low wages. Politically, the autocratic rule of Tsar Nicholas II and the lack of political representation fueled widespread dissatisfaction. Economically, Russia faced challenges such as poor harvests, food shortages, and the financial strain of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), which ended in a humiliating defeat. These factors culminated in widespread protests, strikes, and uprisings, including the infamous Bloody Sunday massacre, where peaceful protesters were killed by the Tsar's troops. The revolution marked a turning point in Russian history, highlighting the growing demand for reform and the weakening of Tsarist authority.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The 1905 Revolution led to several significant outcomes, although it did not result in the overthrow of Tsarist rule. One major outcome was the establishment of the Duma, a parliamentary body, through the October Manifesto, which promised limited political reforms and civil liberties. However, the Tsar retained significant control, and the reforms were largely superficial, failing to address the root causes of discontent. The revolution also exposed the weaknesses of the Tsarist regime and demonstrated the growing power of organized groups, such as workers' councils (soviets) and revolutionary parties like the Bolsheviks. While the immediate impact of the revolution was limited, it set the stage for future uprisings, including the 1917 Russian Revolution, which ultimately led to the fall of the monarchy and the rise of socialism. The 1905 Revolution is significant as it marked the beginning of sustained opposition to Tsarist autocracy and highlighted the potential for mass movements to challenge established power structures.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The First World War had a profound impact on the Russian Empire's economy and society. Economically, the war placed immense strain on Russia's resources. The government struggled to finance the war, leading to inflation and a sharp rise in the cost of living. Food shortages became widespread as agricultural production declined due to the conscription of peasants and the disruption of transportation networks. Industrial production also suffered as factories were repurposed for war efforts, leading to a scarcity of consumer goods. Socially, the war deepened existing inequalities and unrest. The working class faced harsh conditions, while the peasantry grew increasingly discontent with the lack of land reforms. Additionally, the heavy losses suffered by the Russian army (over 2 million soldiers killed by 1917) demoralized the population and eroded trust in the Tsarist regime. These economic and social hardships fueled widespread protests and strikes, ultimately contributing to the revolutionary climate that led to the fall of the Romanov dynasty in 1917.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The Russian Empire played a significant role in the First World War as part of the Allied Powers, fighting primarily against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the Eastern Front. Initially, Russia's vast manpower allowed it to launch large-scale offensives, but poor leadership, inadequate supplies, and outdated military strategies led to devastating defeats, such as the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914. These military failures undermined the credibility of the Tsarist government and exposed its inefficiency. Politically, the war highlighted the weaknesses of the autocratic system. Tsar Nicholas II's decision to take direct command of the army in 1915 left the government in the hands of Tsarina Alexandra and her controversial advisor, Rasputin, further discrediting the monarchy. The war also intensified demands for political reform, as the Duma (Russia's parliament) called for greater involvement in decision-making. The combination of military defeats, economic hardship, and political discontent created a revolutionary atmosphere, culminating in the February Revolution of 1917, which overthrew the Tsarist regime and set the stage for the Bolshevik Revolution later that year.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The term 'After February' refers to the period following the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia. This revolution marked the end of Tsarist autocracy and the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II. It led to the establishment of a Provisional Government, which aimed to introduce democratic reforms. However, the Provisional Government faced significant challenges, including the continuation of Russia's involvement in World War I, economic instability, and rising discontent among workers and peasants. During this period, Soviets (workers' councils) gained influence, and the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, began to advocate for a more radical restructuring of society. The events 'After February' set the stage for the October Revolution, where the Bolsheviks seized power and implemented socialist policies. This period is significant as it highlights the transition from a monarchy to a socialist state and the tensions between moderate and radical political ideologies.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    After the February Revolution, the Provisional Government was established as a temporary authority to govern Russia until a Constituent Assembly could be elected. It was primarily composed of liberals and moderate socialists who sought to implement democratic reforms. At the same time, Soviets, which were councils of workers, soldiers, and peasants, emerged as grassroots organizations advocating for the rights of the working class. Initially, the Provisional Government and the Soviets cooperated in a system known as 'dual power.' However, their relationship became increasingly strained due to differing priorities. The Provisional Government's decision to continue Russia's involvement in World War I and its inability to address economic hardships led to widespread dissatisfaction. The Soviets, particularly the Bolsheviks, capitalized on this discontent by promoting slogans like 'Peace, Land, and Bread.' Over time, the Bolsheviks gained majority support in the Soviets, leading to the October Revolution and the overthrow of the Provisional Government. This period illustrates the competing visions for Russia's future and the eventual dominance of radical socialist ideas.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The October Revolution of 1917, also known as the Bolshevik Revolution, was driven by several key factors. First, the dissatisfaction with the Provisional Government, which had failed to address critical issues such as land reforms, workers' rights, and Russia's continued involvement in World War I, created widespread unrest. Second, the influence of revolutionary ideologies, particularly Lenin's April Theses, which called for 'Peace, Land, and Bread,' resonated with the masses. Third, the role of the Soviets (workers' councils), especially the Petrograd Soviet, in organizing workers, soldiers, and peasants against the government was pivotal. Additionally, the Bolsheviks, under Lenin and Trotsky's leadership, strategically planned and executed the revolution, seizing key locations in Petrograd and overthrowing the Provisional Government. These factors combined to create a revolutionary environment that culminated in the Bolsheviks taking power on October 25, 1917 (Julian calendar).

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Lenin and the Bolshevik Party played a critical role in the success of the October Revolution. Lenin provided ideological leadership through his April Theses, which outlined a clear vision for a socialist revolution, including the withdrawal from World War I, redistribution of land to peasants, and transferring power to the Soviets. The Bolsheviks' ability to mobilize workers, soldiers, and peasants through propaganda and grassroots organization was instrumental. Additionally, Trotsky's role in organizing the Red Guards and planning the actual takeover of key government institutions in Petrograd ensured the revolution's success. The Bolsheviks' disciplined and centralized structure allowed them to act decisively, unlike other socialist factions. Their promise to address the immediate needs of the people—peace, land, and bread—garnered mass support, enabling them to overthrow the Provisional Government and establish Soviet power.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The October Revolution of 1917 had several immediate outcomes. First, the Bolsheviks seized power and established a Soviet government led by Lenin. The Provisional Government was overthrown, and the Soviets, particularly the Petrograd Soviet, became the new centers of power. Second, the Bolsheviks issued key decrees, including the Decree on Peace, which called for an end to Russia's involvement in World War I, and the Decree on Land, which redistributed land to peasants. Third, industries and banks were nationalized, and workers' control over factories was introduced. Additionally, the revolution marked the beginning of a civil war between the Bolsheviks (Reds) and their opponents (Whites), as well as foreign intervention. These outcomes set the stage for the establishment of a communist state and the eventual creation of the Soviet Union.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The American Civil War (1861–1865) was primarily caused by deep-seated divisions between the Northern and Southern states over issues such as slavery, economic policies, and states' rights. Slavery was the central issue, as the Southern economy relied heavily on enslaved labor for its agricultural system, particularly in cotton production. The North, on the other hand, was increasingly industrialized and had largely abolished slavery. Sectionalism further deepened the divide, with the two regions developing distinct social, economic, and political identities. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, who opposed the expansion of slavery, was seen as a direct threat to Southern interests, leading to the secession of several Southern states and the eventual outbreak of war. These factors collectively created irreconcilable tensions, making conflict inevitable.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of all enslaved people in Confederate-held territories. While it did not immediately free all enslaved individuals, it was a turning point in the Civil War. The proclamation shifted the war's focus from merely preserving the Union to also abolishing slavery, giving the North a moral high ground. It also discouraged European powers, such as Britain and France, from supporting the Confederacy, as they had already abolished slavery. Furthermore, the proclamation allowed African Americans to enlist in the Union Army, bolstering its manpower and contributing significantly to its eventual victory. The Emancipation Proclamation laid the groundwork for the Thirteenth Amendment, which permanently abolished slavery in the United States.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Liberals, radicals, and conservatives had distinct perspectives on societal change during the 19th century. Liberals believed in gradual change and emphasized individual freedoms, equality before the law, and the protection of private property. They supported constitutional and parliamentary reforms to ensure these rights. Radicals, on the other hand, advocated for a complete restructuring of society, often calling for universal suffrage, the abolition of private property, and the establishment of a more egalitarian system. Conservatives were opposed to rapid or radical changes and sought to preserve traditional institutions such as the monarchy, the church, and the existing social hierarchy. These differing ideologies influenced the development of socialism, as radicals and some liberals began to explore ideas of collective ownership and equality. Socialism emerged as a critique of the inequalities perpetuated by liberal capitalism and as an alternative to conservative resistance to change.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The Russian Revolution of 1917 played a pivotal role in shaping the concept of a socialist society. It marked the first successful attempt to overthrow a monarchy and establish a government based on socialist principles. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, sought to dismantle the existing feudal and capitalist structures and replace them with a system based on collective ownership of resources and means of production. Key measures included the redistribution of land to peasants, nationalization of industries, and the establishment of workers' councils (soviets) to manage production. The revolution also emphasized the abolition of class distinctions and the creation of a society based on equality and cooperation. However, the implementation of these ideas faced significant challenges, including civil war, economic difficulties, and opposition from other nations. Despite these challenges, the Russian Revolution became a model for other socialist movements worldwide, inspiring efforts to create a classless society.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Stalin's policy of collectivisation aimed to consolidate individual landholdings and labor into collective farms (kolkhozes) to increase agricultural productivity and ensure state control over the rural economy. It was introduced in the late 1920s and implemented aggressively in the early 1930s. Key features included the forced requisitioning of grain, the abolition of private ownership of land, and the establishment of state-controlled farms. The policy led to widespread resistance, particularly from kulaks (wealthy peasants), who were labeled 'enemies of the state' and often deported or executed. The impact was devastating: agricultural production initially plummeted, leading to severe famines, notably the Ukrainian famine (Holodomor) of 1932–1933, which caused millions of deaths. Collectivisation also disrupted traditional rural life and created long-term inefficiencies in Soviet agriculture.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Stalin's collectivisation policy was ideologically driven by Marxist-Leninist principles, which emphasized the abolition of private property and the establishment of a classless society. Stalin believed that collectivisation would eliminate the kulaks as a class, who were seen as exploiting poorer peasants, and align agriculture with socialist ideals of collective ownership. By centralizing agricultural production under state control, Stalin aimed to ensure a steady supply of grain for urban workers and industrialization, which was a key component of his Five-Year Plans. Collectivisation was also intended to consolidate political control over the countryside and suppress dissent. However, the policy's implementation was marked by coercion and violence, raising questions about its alignment with the humanitarian goals of socialism.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The Russian Revolution of 1917 had a profound impact on anti-colonial movements in Asia and Africa. It demonstrated that a successful revolution could overthrow imperialist and capitalist systems, inspiring leaders in colonies to challenge their own oppressors. The USSR actively supported anti-colonial struggles by promoting the idea of self-determination and providing ideological and material support to movements fighting against colonial rule. For instance, leaders like Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam and Jawaharlal Nehru in India were influenced by socialist ideas. The Comintern (Communist International) also played a role in spreading revolutionary ideas globally. This influence helped shape the political discourse in many colonies, leading to the rise of socialist and communist movements as part of their fight for independence.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The USSR played a central role in shaping the global ideological divide during the Cold War by promoting socialism and communism as alternatives to capitalism and liberal democracy, which were championed by the United States. After World War II, the USSR emerged as a superpower and sought to expand its influence by supporting socialist revolutions and governments worldwide. This led to the establishment of the Eastern Bloc in Europe and alliances with countries like Cuba, China (initially), and North Korea. The USSR's ideological stance created a bipolar world order, with nations aligning themselves with either the capitalist West or the socialist East. This divide influenced global politics, economics, and military strategies, leading to proxy wars, the arms race, and the space race. The USSR's efforts to spread socialism were countered by the US's policy of containment, resulting in decades of geopolitical tension.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The Russian Revolution had a significant impact on the development of socialist policies in Europe during the 20th century. It provided a model for revolutionary change and inspired socialist and communist parties across Europe. The success of the Bolsheviks in establishing a socialist state led to the formation of similar movements in countries like Germany, Italy, and France. However, the fear of revolution also prompted governments in capitalist countries to adopt welfare policies to address workers' grievances and prevent unrest. For example, the introduction of labor rights, social security systems, and universal suffrage in many European nations can be partially attributed to the influence of the Russian Revolution. The revolution also led to the establishment of the Comintern, which coordinated socialist activities globally. Despite its influence, the revolution also polarized European politics, leading to the rise of fascism as a counterforce to socialism in countries like Italy and Germany.

Under collectivisation, private farms were abolished, and peasants were forced to work on collective farms (kolkhozes) controlled by the state. By 1929, Stalin announced the 'Dekulakization' campaign, targeting wealthier peasants (kulaks) who resisted collectivisation. Millions of peasants were displaced, and widespread resistance led to violent crackdowns. The policy resulted in a severe famine between 1932 and 1933, particularly in Ukraine, where it is estimated that 3-5 million people died.
