The Kaveri River originates from the Brahmagiri hills in the Western Ghats, in the state of Karnataka. It flows eastward and drains into the Bay of Bengal. The total length of the Kaveri River is approximately 800 kilometers. The basin covers an area of about 81,155 square kilometers, spanning across the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Puducherry. The river is vital for irrigation, drinking water, and hydroelectric power generation in the region. The Kaveri is also known for its delta, which is one of the most fertile regions in India.</div>

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The Himalayan rivers are perennial, meaning they have water throughout the year due to their sources in glaciers and snow-fed regions. They originate from the northern mountain ranges, such as the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra. These rivers have long courses, cutting through the mountains to form deep gorges. In their upper courses, they perform intensive erosional activity, while in the middle and lower courses, they form depositional features like meanders and oxbow lakes. In contrast, the Peninsular rivers are mostly rain-fed, seasonal, and have shorter courses. They flow over hard rocks and plateaus, leading to less erosional activity and more stable courses. The Himalayan rivers also contribute to the formation of fertile plains, unlike the Peninsular rivers.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    The Peninsular Rivers in India are primarily rain-fed and non-perennial, meaning their flow depends on monsoon rainfall and they often dry up during the dry season. Unlike the Himalayan Rivers, which are perennial due to snowmelt and rainfall, Peninsular Rivers have shorter courses and are largely confined to the plateau regions. They generally flow in fixed courses without significant meandering due to the hard terrain of the Peninsular Plateau. Major Peninsular Rivers include the Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, and Mahanadi, which drain into the Bay of Bengal, while some rivers like the Narmada and Tapi flow westward into the Arabian Sea. These rivers also exhibit limited erosional activity and are known for forming deltas at their mouths. Understanding these differences is crucial for comprehending the distinct hydrological patterns and geographical features of India's drainage systems.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Oxbow lakes are formed when a river meander is cut off from the main river channel due to the deposition of silt and sediment. This process occurs over time as the river erodes its outer banks and deposits sediment on its inner banks, creating a loop-like bend. Eventually, the neck of the meander narrows and is cut off, forming a standalone water body known as an oxbow lake. These lakes are significant as they provide insights into the dynamics of river systems, including erosion, deposition, and changes in river courses. Additionally, oxbow lakes serve as habitats for diverse aquatic species and play a role in local ecosystems.

                    Peninsular rivers are primarily rain-fed and seasonal, meaning their flow depends on monsoon rainfall. Unlike Himalayan rivers, they are not perennial and often experience reduced flow during dry periods. Peninsular rivers originate from the Western Ghats or central highlands and flow eastward, draining into the Bay of Bengal. Some rivers, like the Narmada and Tapi, flow westward into the Arabian Sea. They generally have shorter courses compared to Himalayan rivers and lack extensive meandering due to the hard and rocky terrain. Additionally, Peninsular rivers do not form gorges or deep valleys as they flow through relatively stable geological regions. This contrasts with Himalayan rivers, which are perennial, originate from glaciers, and exhibit features like gorges, meanders, and oxbow lakes due to their erosional activity.
